This project was done in the context of a semester paper of Maelys Lerat during the spring semester 2020 at ETH Zurich.
The goal was implementing (from scratch) algorithms for the Lower-Left-Anchored Rectangle Packing Problem and checking the validity of some proposed conjectures for this problem.

The problem in question was later largely resolved by this ICALP 2021 paper:
